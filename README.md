# MacGodsReplacement

MacGodsReplacement is an AI-driven chatbot designed to provide assistance and support. It leverages the OpenAI API to generate responses, at a glace of the code you can see the sarcastic instruction I have provided the bot, so this is more of a fun project rather than a full blown attempt at an operational chatbot capable of support.

## Requirements

This script requires Python 3 and the following Python packages:

- openai
- python-dotenv

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

1. Save your OpenAI API key in a file named `Key.env` in the same directory as the script. The content of the `Key.env` file should be:

```bash
OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

2. Save the chatbot script in a file named `bot.py`.

## Usage

To run the chatbot, navigate to the directory containing the script and `Key.env` file, and type:

```bash
python bot.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter a message. After you enter a message, it will print out a response generated by the OpenAI model. You can continue entering messages to keep the conversation going.

## Customization

You can tailor the chatbot to your preferences by changing the following variables in the script:

- `chatbot_name`: The name of the chatbot.
- `chatbot_persona`: The persona of the chatbot.
- `chatbot_history`: The history of the chatbot.
- `chatbot_temperature`: The temperature of the chatbot.
- `chatbot_max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens that the chatbot will generate.
